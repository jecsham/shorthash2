> Mainly based on [shorthash](https://github.com/bibig/node-shorthash) (apparently abandoned), by Bibig, **shorthash2** offers a small optimization in memory usage, small features and is available for **Browser** and **NodeJs**.

+ A mini js lib to generate short, alpha-number, undecryptable and unique hash id from a long string (utf8 format).
+ Use shorthash2 when you want to encrypt a string like a movie name or a people name to a short, unique and url friendly id.
+ so with shorthash2, you can build an id-string map, instead of quering the id from db each time, you just calculate the id out on the fly. 
+ it's quite convenient in many conditions if you want to build a site like [书本画](http://shubenhua.com), a book search engine in China.
